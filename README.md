# FabrikamFiber

This project was originally started by Richard Hundhausen and distributed on [CodePlex](https://fabrikam.codeplex.com/) as an application for training users in Visual Studio and development practices.

I have archived it here since I frequently use it for examples rebuilding existing applications to run in containers.

## Step by Step - Getting Started & Azure Service Fabric

There's a great guide on how to use this to test building Docker containers and deploying them to Azure Service Fabric [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-host-app-in-a-container).

If you want to try a different orchestrator, follow the steps through the first **Test your container** section, then pick from the next sections here:

### Kubernetes


### Docker Swarm
